# CSCI8920-
repo for final

This was done by Cameron Pipes and Devin Bailey as a final project for CSCI82920: Decision Making Under Uncertainty.

It features a generic FSM class used to construct FSMs. A method for evolving those FSMs to be more fit to play against a suite of defined opponents for common game theory games.
